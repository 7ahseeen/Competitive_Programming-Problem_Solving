#	Hello, folks.
#	Here's the solutions to the  ICPC Assiut University Community - Newcomers Training in C language.
#	Pardon me for not adding comments to the codes.
#	Hope you all find it helpful :)

#  NOTES  ----------
-  The codes were accepted when chosen compiler was "C++17 (GCC 7-32)"
-  Sometimes using 'double' instead of 'float' doesn't work for the exact same code
